# Formalization of equivariant cartesian cubical type theory

This code is adapted from [the code accompanying Ian Orton's thesis](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/288558) along with modifications from [gen-cart](https://github.com/mortberg/gen-cart).

Some files take time to check (up to a minute on my machine). This is mostly spent checking that type formers commute with substitution, which is generally true by definition but time-consuming for Agda to check.
