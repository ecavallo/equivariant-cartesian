# Formalization of an equivariant cartesian cubical set model of type theory

This formalization accompanies the article

> The equivariant model structure on cartesian cubical sets.
> Steve Awodey, Evan Cavallo, Thierry Coquand, Emily Riehl, and Christian Sattler

The contents of the formalization are summarized in Appendix A of the article.

The formalization defines a model of homotopy type theory inside an extensional type
theory augmented with a flat modality and axioms postulating *shapes* (among them an
*interval*) and a cofibration classifier. The results can in particular be externalized in
the category of cartesian cubical sets.
